# nixos-images

Automatically build images for NixOS. 
This project is meant to extend images builded by hydra.nixos.org.
We currently build:
    - netboot images: see [bzImage](https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-images/releases/download/nixos-unstable/bzImage-x86_64-linux) and [initrd](https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-images/releases/download/nixos-unstable/bzImage-x86_64-linux)
    - and [kexec](https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-images/releases/download/nixos-unstable/kexec-bundle-x86_64-linux) images
Images are weekly updated.
