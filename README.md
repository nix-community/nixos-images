# nixos-images

Automatically build images for NixOS. This project is meant to extend images built by hydra.nixos.org.
We currently build:

- netboot images: see [bzImage](https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-images/releases/download/nixos-unstable/bzImage-x86_64-linux) and [initrd](https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-images/releases/download/nixos-unstable/bzImage-x86_64-linux)
- and [kexec](https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-images/releases/download/nixos-unstable/kexec-bundle-x86_64-linux) images

Images are weekly updated.
